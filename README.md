## Tic-Tac-Toe web application

I built a Tic-Tac-Toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application included functions to handle user clicks, track the game state, and check for winning conditions, creating an interactive and engaging game experience. Users could play against each other, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
